üìö PLP Bookstore ‚Äì MongoDB Project
üìñ Overview

This project demonstrates how to work with MongoDB using a collection of classic books.
It covers CRUD operations, advanced queries, aggregation pipelines, indexing, and pagination.

The dataset contains popular books with fields like title, author, genre, published_year, price, in_stock, pages, and publisher.

üõ†Ô∏è Requirements

MongoDB Community Server
MongoDB Compass
Node.js
üìÇ Project Structure
plp-bookstore/
‚îÇ
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ queries.js   # All MongoDB commands: CRUD, queries, aggregation, indexing
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ seed.js      # (optional) Script to insert sample books data
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md    # Documentation

‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run
Make sure your MongoDB server is running locally on port 27017:
net start MongoDB
or (Linux/Mac):
mongod
2. Insert Data
Run the seed.js file to insert the sample books into the plp_bookstore database:
mongosh "mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017" seed.js
3. Run Queries
Execute all queries from the queries.js file:
#bash
mongosh "mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017" queries.js
üß™ Example Queries
üîπ CRUD Operations
Find all books in the Fantasy genre:
#js
db.books.find({ genre: "Fantasy" })
Update the price of To Kill a Mockingbird:
db.books.updateOne(
  { title: "To Kill a Mockingbird" },
  { $set: { price: 15.99 } }
)
üîπ Advanced Queries
#Books in stock published after 2010:
db.books.find({ in_stock: true, published_year: { $gt: 2010 } })
#Projection (only title, author, price):
db.books.find({}, { title: 1, author: 1, price: 1, _id: 0 })
#Sorting by price (descending):
db.books.find({}, { title: 1, author: 1, price: 1, _id: 0 }).sort({ price: -1 })
#Pagination (5 per page):
db.books.find().skip(5).limit(5)

üîπ Aggregation
#Average book price by genre:
db.books.aggregate([
  { $group: { _id: "$genre", averagePrice: { $avg: "$price" } } }
])
#Most published author:
db.books.aggregate([
  { $group: { _id: "$author", totalBooks: { $sum: 1 } } },
  { $sort: { totalBooks: -1 } },
  { $limit: 1 }
])
#Group by publication decade:
db.books.aggregate([
  {
    $group: {
      _id: {
        decade: { $multiply: [ { $floor: { $divide: [ "$published_year", 10 ] } }, 10 ] }
      },
      totalBooks: { $sum: 1 }
    }
  },
  { $sort: { "_id.decade": 1 } }
])

üîπ Indexing
#Create index on title:
db.books.createIndex({ title: 1 })
#Create compound index on author and published_year:
db.books.createIndex({ author: 1, published_year: 1 })

‚úÖ Conclusion

This project helps you practice:

Creating and querying MongoDB collections

Using projections, sorting, and pagination

Performing advanced analytics with the aggregation pipeline

Optimizing queries with indexes
